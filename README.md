This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Front and Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

You can run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Front end Installation ###

"npm install" to install all modules
"npm run start" to run the app
The project should be running at http://localhost:8086/
